# Rock-Paper-Scissors(Rochambeau)

## Personal Feeling

YEAHHHHH! I did finish the project successfully. It was just a simple Rochambeau game. YES! Originally it was one of the names for this game (you can learn more about it here), which we call Rock, Paper, and Scissors for some reason. This was one of the project assignments in the Foundation course of TOP (The Odin Project). Overall, I think it was pretty much easy to do, and there wasn't anything specific that made me lose my mind (not yet, lol). Because I already have some programming experience in different programming languages like Python, and I even have some prior experience with JavaScript as well. 

## Project Description

It's just a simple Rock, Paper, and Scissors game made using HTML and JavaScript. You play this game with a computer, so your opponent is not a human being. First, you're asked for an input, for which you can enter rock, paper, or scissors. Then, the computer will randomly choose one as well. Finally, the winner is determined based on standard game rules (for example, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock). If you choose something that defeats the computer's choice, you're the winner; otherwise, you're the loser. It doesn't have any GUI yet; rather, it's played mostly on console.

## Challanges And Problems

I want to be honest; I didn't face any big problems or challenges while building this project. There were some small problems and challenges here and there, but I can't remember any serious ones.

## Learning Experience

I think I learned better how to use functions more effectively; other than that, I think everything else was straightforward.
